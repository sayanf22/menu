- ✅ Brute force protection via Supabase

## 🚫 What's NOT Exposed

### Environment Variables
- ❌ Service role key (never in frontend)
- ❌ Database passwords
- ❌ API secrets
- ✅ Only anon key exposed (safe by design)

### Sensitive Data
- ❌ User passwords (hashed by Supabase)
- ❌ Email addresses (protected by RLS)
- ❌ Other users' data
- ❌ Admin credentials

## 🔐 Secrets Management

### Frontend (.env)
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=xxx  # Safe to expose
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=xxx         # Safe to expose
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=xxx  # Safe to expose (anon key)
```

### Backend (Supabase Edge Functions)
```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=xxx  # NEVER expose to frontend
RESEND_API_KEY=xxx             # Only in Edge Functions
ADMIN_EMAIL=xxx                # Only in Edge Functions
```

## 🛡️ Security Headers

```
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
